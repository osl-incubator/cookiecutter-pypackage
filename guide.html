<h2>Notes about the text-based user interface (TUI)<a class="headerlink" href="#notes-about-the-text-based-user-interface-tui" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>A TUI, or text-based user interface, is a type of user interface that uses text
and keyboard input to display and interact with information on a computer
screen.</p>
<p>When you run the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">scicookie</span></code> command in your terminal, a text-based user
interface (TUI) is displayed where you can provide information about the author
or the project itself. You can also choose from several options that are
presented to you, with default values in all cases. To switch from one option to
another, simply press “Enter”.</p>
<p>In some cases, you may see a list of sub-options within a main option. Use the
arrow keys to move up and down between the sub-options and the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&gt;</span></code> symbol will
appear before the sub-option you have selected. Make sure you press “Enter” to
confirm your selection when the required sub-option has been selected.</p>
<p>You will also see a list of options for the project tools, this is presented in
the following way:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span> <span class="p">]</span> <span class="n">bandit</span>
   <span class="p">[</span> <span class="p">]</span> <span class="n">black</span>
   <span class="p">[</span> <span class="p">]</span> <span class="n">blue</span>
   <span class="p">[</span> <span class="p">]</span> <span class="n">conda</span>
   <span class="p">[</span> <span class="p">]</span> <span class="n">coverage</span>
   <span class="p">[</span> <span class="p">]</span> <span class="n">flake8</span>
   <span class="p">[</span> <span class="p">]</span> <span class="n">ruff</span>
   <span class="p">[</span> <span class="p">]</span> <span class="n">isort</span>
   <span class="p">[</span> <span class="p">]</span> <span class="n">mccabe</span>
   <span class="p">[</span> <span class="p">]</span> <span class="n">pre</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">commit</span>
   <span class="p">[</span> <span class="p">]</span> <span class="n">pydocstyle</span>
   <span class="p">[</span> <span class="p">]</span> <span class="n">pytest</span>
   <span class="p">[</span> <span class="p">]</span> <span class="n">hypothesis</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Use the right arrow key to select the tools you want, and use the up and down
arrow keys to navigate through the list. If you accidentally select an option
you don’t want, simply use the left arrow key to deselect it.</p>
<p>The following is a description of the options in the TUI.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-author-of-project">
<h2>The author of project<a class="headerlink" href="#the-author-of-project" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>With SciCookie, you can easily add information about the author of the
project by filling in the <strong>author_full_name</strong> and <strong>author_email</strong> fields,
which refer to the name and email address of the person or organization
that authored the project.</p>
<p>The default values give you an idea of what you can enter in these
fields. This information can be found in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyproject.toml</span></code> file, the
documentation and the github configuration, to name a few.</p>
</section>
<section id="information-about-the-project">
<h2>Information about the project<a class="headerlink" href="#information-about-the-project" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Every project needs specific information for both development and
maintenance. SciCookie allows you to customise this information, which
is displayed in several parts, such as: documentation, git,
configuration files, the project repository, PyPI (Python Package Index)
and more.</p>
<p>Below are the fields within the TUI that relate to project information:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>project_name</strong>: This is the name of the project according to the
creator, i.e. the main title of the project, as shown on the README
page, for example.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>project_slug</strong>: This is the name of the project, probably
abbreviated using characters suitable for naming a Python package.
Also, it is the name used for the repository and the one registered
with PyPI. In simpler terms, it refers to the name of the python
package to use when you want to install it. In SciCookie, this name
can include hyphens (-) or underscores (_).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>package_slug</strong>: This refers to the name used when importing the
package. This name allows the usage of (_) instead of (-), which is a
particularity of SciCookie. Consequently, the <em>project_slug</em> and the
<em>package_slug</em> can match (when both use underscores).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>project_version</strong>: This is where you can enter the version of your
python package, most Python packages use semantic versioning.
SciCookie offers you to manage the release workflow with semantic
release and github actions. For more information on releasing and
versioning, please click
<a class="reference external" href="https://py-pkgs.org/07-releasing-versioning.html">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>project_url</strong>: This is the URL of the project’s website used for
example, in the documentation and the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyproject.toml</span></code> file. On this
website you will generally find information about the project, the
team, events, the blog, etc. It is used to promote the project.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>project_license</strong>: This field allows you to specify the license of
the project. In SciCookie you can find and choose from the following
well-known open source software licenses: <em>MIT</em>, <em>BSD 3 Clauses</em>, <em>ISC
license</em>, <em>Apache Software License 2.0</em> and <em>GNU General Public License v3</em>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MIT</span></code> option</strong>: is a free software license that allows users to use,
modify and redistribute the software without significant restrictions.
It is a permissive license that allows users to do whatever they want
with the software, as long as a copy of the license is included and

<h2>Project settings<a class="headerlink" href="#project-settings" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Setting up some configurations in the project structure is important because it
allows you to get an orderly workflow. With SciCookie you can configure elements
such as project layout, build system, command-line interface and documentation
engine. This can help streamline the development process by providing a
consistent and standardized framework for the project.</p>
<section id="project-layout">
<h3>Project layout<a class="headerlink" href="#project-layout" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The organization of your code is important, which is why at SciCookie we offer
two alternatives: <em>src</em> and <em>flat</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>src (Source) layout</strong>: The src layout is a common approach where the source
code files are organized within a dedicated “src” directory. This directory
serves as the root of the project’s source code and typically contains
subdirectories that represent different modules or packages. Each module or
package within the “src” directory focuses on a specific aspect of the
project’s functionality.</p>
<p>For example, a project following the src structure might have the following
layout:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>project_slug/
├─ src/
│  └─ package_slug/
│     ├─ __init__.py
|     ├─ __main__.py
│     ├─ module.py
│     └─ ...
├─ tests
│  └─ ...
├── pyproject.toml
└── README.md
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The src structure helps in organizing the codebase and makes it easier to
understand and maintain as the project grows larger. It also allows for better
separation of concerns and promotes modularity.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Flat layout</strong>: The flat layout involves placing all the project’s source
code files directly in the project’s root directory without any
subdirectories. This means that all modules and packages are at the same level
and there is no explicit separation between different aspects of the project.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of a flat structure:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>project_slug/
│ └─ package_slug/
│ __init__.py
| __main__.py
│ module.py
│ ...
├─ tests
│  └─ ...
├── pyproject.toml
└── README.md
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Because all source files are on the same level in this layout, they are easy to
find and access. However, as the project becomes larger and more complex, it can
become more difficult to maintain and navigate the codebase.</p>
<p>The flat structure is simpler and may be suitable for smaller projects or
scripts where the codebase is relatively small and does not require extensive
organization or separation of concerns.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both <strong>src</strong> and <strong>flat</strong> layouts have their own advantages and disadvantages.
The choice between them depends on your specific requirements and the complexity
of your project, as well as your personal preferences and team conventions.</p>

<section id="command-line-interfaces-clis">
<h3>Command-line interfaces (CLIs)<a class="headerlink" href="#command-line-interfaces-clis" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>A command line interface (CLI) is a type of text-based interface that
allows the user to interact with a program or system using text commands
rather than a graphical interface. It allows automation of tasks, access
to advanced functions, and execution of complex commands with additional
options.</p>
<p>In addition to the operating system’s native CLI, many programs and
tools provide their own command line interfaces to facilitate
interaction with their functionality. With SciCookie you have two CLI
options: <em>Click</em> and <em>Argparse</em>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/"><strong>Click</strong></a>: The <em>Command
Line Interface Creation Kit</em> is a Python package that allows you to
create beautiful command line interfaces in a composable way with as
little code as necessary. It is highly configurable, it aims to make
the process of writing command line tools quick and fun.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html"><strong>Argparse</strong></a>: This
is the recommended command line parsing module in the Python standard
library, and provides an easy way to create command line interfaces
with custom arguments and options. It helps you parse user-supplied
arguments and options, and automatically generate help and usage
messages.</p></li>

<section id="documentation-engine">
<h3>Documentation engine<a class="headerlink" href="#documentation-engine" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>One of the most important elements of a package (apart from the
functionality of the code) is its documentation.  If there is no quality
documentation, it is very likely that people will not understand and
therefore not use your package.</p>
<p>To generate documentation for any project, tools have been developed
that include functions such as content creation and editing,
organization and classification of information, generation of output
formats and integration with other development and project management
tools, known as a <strong>documentation engine</strong>. This tool automates the
creation of technical documentation for software projects by extracting
information from source code, comments and project metadata.</p>
<p>Depending on your taste and the needs of your project, you should choose
the documentation engine that best suits your needs. SciCookie offers
you three documentation engine options for your Python package:
<em>mkdocs</em>, <em>sphinx</em> and <em>jupyter-book</em>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.mkdocs.org/"><strong>mkdocs</strong></a>: is a fast, simple, and
downright gorgeous static site generator for creating project
documentation. Documentation source files are written in <em>Markdown</em>
and configured with a single <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">YAML</span></code> configuration file. It is designed
to allow users to quickly create clear and well-structured
documentation without requiring advanced programming skills. <em>mkdocs</em>
can be easily integrated with version control systems such as Git,
supports a variety of predefined themes that allow you to customise
the visual appearance of your documentation. In SciCookie, so far, we
use the <em>material</em> theme to generate documentation with <em>mkdocs</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/"><strong>Sphinx</strong></a>: <em>Sphinx</em> makes it
easy to create intelligent and attractive documentation. It provides
various output formats such as HTML, LaTeX, ePub, Texinfo, manual
pages, plain text. It also generates automatic links to functions,
classes, citations, glossary terms and similar information. It allows
the use of built-in extensions for automatic code snippet checking,
the inclusion of docstrings from Python modules, and third-party
extensions to include many more features. <em>Sphinx</em> uses the
<em>reStructuredText</em> markup language by default and can read <em>MyST</em> markdown
through third-party extensions.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html"><strong>Jupyter Book</strong></a>:
allows you to create engaging, publication-quality books and documents
from computational content. <em>Jupyter Book</em> uses Jupyter notebooks as the
basis for creating interactive content. It allows you to structure and
organise the notebooks into a cohesive, navigable book. It also offers
customisation options to adapt the look and feel of the book to your
needs and extensions to add additional features. It can generate books
in a variety of output formats, including HTML, PDF and static web
pages. It integrates well with version control systems such as Git.</p></li>

<section id="project-tools">
<h2>Project tools<a class="headerlink" href="#project-tools" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>SciCookie allows you to choose between several tools that can improve your
project in different ways. Some of these tools can help you automate tasks,
others allow you to format your code consistently, and others can help you find
errors and vulnerabilities in your code, and much more.</p>
<p>The tools are described below according to their functionality.</p>
<section id="virtual-environment">
<h3>Virtual Environment<a class="headerlink" href="#virtual-environment" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>When working with Python, you should always have a virtual environment.
This is an isolated space where you can install and run applications and
software packages independently, without interfering with other
environments or versions on your system. You control which package
versions are installed and when they are updated. Virtual environments
are disposable; you can delete and create as many as you like. In Python
there are many tools to manage virtual environments, in SciCookie we
offer you the option to use <em>conda</em> as your environment management
system, which is a very popular option in the Python scientific
community.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/"><strong>Conda</strong></a>: is an open source
package and environment management system that runs on Windows, MacOS
and Linux. It quickly installs, runs and updates packages and their
dependencies. It also makes it easy to create, save, load and switch
between environments on your local machine, which is why we use conda
as an option in SciCookie. If you want an easy way to choose a
specific version of Python, and if your project relies on complex
software libraries that are not easily installed with pip, using conda
is a good option. It is included in all versions of Anaconda and
Miniconda.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="code-formatter">
<h3>Code formatter<a class="headerlink" href="#code-formatter" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>A code formatter is a tool that automatically reformats code to conform to a set
of coding standards, such as PEP 8 guidelines. It helps us ensure consistency in
our code, saves time by automating the formatting process, reduces errors by
enforcing coding standards, and facilitates collaboration by making it easier
for multiple developers to work on the same code base. In the options of
SciCookie, you will find two choices: <em>Black</em> and <em>Blue</em>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://black.readthedocs.io"><strong>Black</strong></a>: It is a popular code formatter tool
for Python that automatically formats code to conform to PEP 8 guidelines. It
provides a simple and opinionated way to format code, making it easy to use. The
advantages of using Black include its ability to ensure consistent formatting,
save time by automating the process, and reduce errors by enforcing coding
standards.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can read the <a class="reference external" href="https://black.readthedocs.io"><em>black documentation</em></a> if you
want to know more about it.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://blue.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"><strong>Blue</strong></a>: is a slightly less
rigid code formatter than <em>black</em>, it contains only a few improvements
that the maintainers have considered. It is hoped that in time it can
be merged with the <em>black</em> project. Some differences between <em>blue</em>
and <em>black</em>: <em>blue</em> defaults to single-quoted strings for everything
except docstrings and triple-quoted strings (TQS). <em>blue</em> defaults to
79-character line lengths, preserving whitespace before the pad for
right-justified comments. It also supports multiple configuration
files: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyproject.toml</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">setup.cfg</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tox.ini</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.blue</span></code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you select both <em>Blue</em> and <em>Black</em> libraries in the TUI (Terminal User
Interface), you will see the following message: “The libs Blue and Black were
selected, but you need to choose just one of them.” and the template generation
process will be stopped.</p>
<p>Using code formatters such as <em>Black</em> or <em>Blue</em> in your project helps ensure
consistent and readable code, making it easier to maintain and collaborate on.</p>

<section id="code-security-vulnerabilities">
<h3>Code Security Vulnerabilities<a class="headerlink" href="#code-security-vulnerabilities" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The code security vulnerabilities are errors or weaknesses in code that can be
exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access, steal data, or cause damage
to a system.</p>
<p>To verify and prevent these vulnerabilities, there are several tools available
in Python. One such tool available in SciCookie is <em>Bandit</em>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://bandit.readthedocs.io"><strong>Bandit</strong></a>: It is a tool specifically designed to
identify security issues in Python code. It scans code for common security
problems such as hard-coded passwords and insecure file permissions. Some of the
key features of Bandit are its ease of use, its ability to integrate with other
tools and support for multiple versions of Python. To learn more about Bandit,
you can read its <a class="reference external" href="https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">documentation</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to use code vulnerability detection tools because they can help
identify security vulnerabilities in software and fix them before they can be
exploited by attackers. This helps to ensure the security and reliability of the
project.</p>

<section id="code-coverage-testing">
<h3>Code coverage testing<a class="headerlink" href="#code-coverage-testing" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Code coverage testing is a software testing method that measures the percentage
of code that is executed during a test run. This can be used to identify areas
of code that are not being tested and to improve the overall quality of the
software.</p>
<p>There are a number of different code coverage tools available in Python. In
SciCookie you have <em>coverage</em> available.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://coverage.readthedocs.io/"><strong>Coverage</strong></a>: It is an open source tool
for measuring the code coverage of a program. This means that it measures what
percentage of the program code was executed when the tests were run. Coverage
can be useful for identifying parts of the code that are not being tested and
may be vulnerable to bugs. This will show you the percentage of code covered by
your tests, as well as detailed information about which lines were executed and
which were not. If you want to know more about how it works, you can read the
<a class="reference external" href="https://coverage.readthedocs.io/">Coverge documentation</a>.</p></li>

<section id="code-style-and-logic-code-quality">
<h3>Code style and logic (code quality)<a class="headerlink" href="#code-style-and-logic-code-quality" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Code style refers to the way in which your code is written. It includes things
like indentation, line breaks, and variable names. Code logic refers to the way
in which your code works. It includes things like the flow of your code, the use
of data structures, and the implementation of algorithms.</p>
<p>There are a number of tools that can help you to improve the code style and
logic of your Python code; analyzing and verification of the code. In SciCookie
you can choose and include in your project <em>flake8</em>, <em>Ruff</em>, <em>isort</em>, <em>mccabe</em>,
<em>pydocstyle</em> and/or <em>vulture</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://flake8.pycqa.org/"><strong>Flake8</strong></a>: A tool that helps you find potential
performance issues in your code. Flake8 can detect errors in syntax,
indentation, naming conventions, and other types of style errors. It can be
useful for improving the quality of Python code. Flake8 enforces coding style
conventions defined in the Python Enhancement Proposal 8 (PEP 8).
Additionally, flake8 integrates well with popular code editors like Visual
Studio Code, PyCharm, and Sublime Text. It can highlight style violations
directly in your editor, making it easy to spot and fix issues as you write
code. Flake8 can also be integrated into continuous integration and deployment
(CI/CD) pipelines to ensure code quality standards are met before merging
changes.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/"><strong>Ruff</strong></a>: This is an extremely fast Python
linter written in Rust. Linting is the process of inspect code for potential
bugs or style issues, and Ruff is designed to perform this analysis quickly
and efficiently. It is particularly useful for large codebases where
traditional Python linters can be slow and resource intensive.</p>
<p>Ruff is designed to be easy to use and can be integrated into existing Python
development workflows. It can be used as a standalone command line tool, or
integrated into editors and IDEs using plugins or extensions. It is also able to
detect a wide range of potential errors and style issues, and provides clear and
detailed error messages to help developers resolve these issues quickly.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://pycqa.github.io/isort/"><strong>isort</strong></a>: is a Python

of configuration options to suit each project’s import style
preferences, has official pre-commit support and is black-compatible.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://here-be-pythons.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/mccabe.html"><strong>McCabe</strong></a>:
is a code complexity checker that automatically detects code
complexity based on cyclomatic complexity, which is roughly equal to
one plus the number of loops and if statements. Simply put, it
provides an upper bound on the number of test cases needed to obtain
branch coverage of the code. It is recommended to run it during the
git hook pre-commit.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture"><strong>Vulture</strong></a>: finds unused
code in Python programs. This is useful for cleaning up and finding
bugs in large code bases. Due to the dynamic nature of Python, static
code analysers such as <em>Vulture</em> are likely to miss some dead code.
However, it can be a very useful tool for improving code quality. It
uses static code analysis, it is self-testing and has full test
coverage, it complements pyflakes and has the same output syntax, it
sorts classes and functions by size and it supports Python &gt;= 3.6,
these are some of the main features of <em>Vulture</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.pydocstyle.org/en/stable/"><strong>pydocstyle</strong></a>: is a static
